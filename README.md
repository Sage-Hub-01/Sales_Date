# Sales Performance Analysis - Power BI Portfolio Project

## Overview

This project is a sales performance analysis report and dashboard created using Microsoft Power BI. It analyzes sample sales data to provide insights into key metrics such as total revenue, number of orders, number of customers, and average order value. The report also explores sales trends over time, top-performing products, and regional sales performance.

## Project Goals

* Demonstrate proficiency in using Power BI to connect to data, transform data, create calculated measures using DAX, design interactive reports, and build a dashboard.
* Analyze sales data to identify key trends and insights.
* Create a visually appealing and informative report and dashboard that effectively communicates findings.
* Fulfill the requirements for a portfolio project to showcase skills for the PL-300 certification.

## Data Sources

* Sample Sales Data: A CSV file containing sales transaction data, including order ID, customer ID, product information, sales date, region, quantity, price, and discount information.

## Tools Used

* Microsoft Power BI Desktop
* Microsoft Power BI Service

## Key Skills Demonstrated

* **Data Connection and Transformation:** Connecting to CSV data in Power BI Desktop and using Power Query Editor to ensure correct data types (particularly for the "Discount (%)" column).
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Creating calculated measures to derive key performance indicators (KPIs), including:
    * Total Revenue
    * Number of Orders
    * Number of Customers
    * Average Order Value
* **Report Design:** Designing a multi-page report with visualizations to effectively communicate sales performance insights. Visualizations include:
    * KPI cards
    * Map visualization
    * Line chart
    * Bar chart
    * Pie/Donut chart
* **Interactive Reports:** Implementing slicers to enable users to filter data and explore specific aspects of the sales data.
* **Dashboard Creation:** Publishing the report to the Power BI Service and creating a dashboard to provide a high-level overview of key metrics.
* **Data Analysis:** Identifying key trends and insights from the sales data.

## Report Pages

The report consists of the following pages:

1.  **Overview:** Provides a high-level summary of sales performance, including KPI cards, a map showing sales by region, and a line chart showing sales trends over time.
2.  **Product Analysis:** Focuses on product performance, including a bar chart of top-selling products and a pie/donut chart showing sales by product category.
3.  **Customer/Location Analysis (Optional):** (If included) Analyzes sales by customer location (country) and order priority.

## Dashboard

The dashboard provides a concise overview of the most important metrics and insights from the report, allowing stakeholders to quickly grasp the current sales performance. Key visuals from the report are pinned to the dashboard.

## Project Structure

The repository contains the following files:

* `Sample Sales Data.csv`: The CSV data file used for the analysis.
* `Sales Performance Analysis.pbix`: The Power BI Desktop file containing the report.
